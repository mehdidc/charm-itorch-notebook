# Overview

This charms aims at deploying a iPython Notebook for Data Scientist and pythonistas to play with. 

# Usage

Once you have juju installed, 

    juju deploy ipython-notebook
    juju expose ipython-notebook


You can then browse to https://ip-address. (don't forget the httpS)

The default password is "secret" but you can change that in the configuration. 

## Scale out Usage

Obviously notebooks are useless to scale, unless used in a training environment. 

## Known Limitations and Issues

* Simple deployment and no fun options for now. 

# Configuration

* password: By default, "secret". Can be changed to anything not empty. If left empty, the default will apply.
