description: |
  IPython can be used as a replacement for the standard Python shell, or
  it can be used as a complete working environment for scientific
  computing (like Matlab or Mathematica) when paired with the standard
  Python scientific and numerical tools. It supports dynamic object
  introspections, numbered input/output prompts, a macro system, session
  logging, session restoring, complete system shell access, verbose and
  colored traceback reports, auto-parentheses, auto-quoting, and is
  embeddable in other Python programs.  This package contains the basic
  terminal shell. For the qt console install ipython-qtconsole and for
  the html notebook install ipython-notebook.
